                It is easily integrable , Ultimately fast and is in the Highest end of security integration. Also it is lively

                language a usable , more powerful and understandable. The communication between each of these devices are done
                via the My sensors switch which was developed using python, A high-end application switch which works as a
                massage broker. Once client devices are registered in the switch they should share their data to specific
                people(Other client devices). Then the. Then they are capable of sharing massages accordingly.
                </span>
                </p>
                <p>Currently MySensors switch is implemented on two languages one is <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and the other one is <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>. In either case it doesn't matter in which language your clients are built on.
                  You can use either of the implementations to suit your product. currently there are two implementation which works on UDP packet connection and TCP packet connections.

                <h1>What is senz Switch ??</h1>

                <p>senz switch is the core working body of this amazing system. This exhibits its outstanding features that can beat the
                  systems that is available on the market. It is a compound collection of several features in to one and is the key
                  to its multithreaded high speed massage passing system, it is also integrated with its security features that beats
                  any of the available systems in the market. High availability and Higher bandwidth is achieved through python Twisted.
                  senz switch is integrated with a MongoDB database to keep its user registration data ,public and private keys stored,
                  timely information etc. but the interesting thing here is that it does not keep any of the passed data or even read
                  those data when passing. <br>So you don't need to worry about using your private devices connected with SENZ to have
                  second though that your data is revealed and passed through unknown servers. Because you are 100% that when the data
                  is encrypted and it can only be decrypted in to the massage only by the intended end device and the device only.
                </p>

                <h1>what's for you Developers....... ?</h1>

                <p align="justify">It is obvious that you might have the idea that  will it be possible for us to integrate it in to our
                  system. Or How could we use it in our systems. Sure its the very reason why we have build this in the
                  way it is.<br>
                  You developers can develop your applications on top of this platform. There is a senZ switch written
                  on python. So you will have to install it in a separate server . Then you can use the developed senz
                  client service written to multiple platforms both mobile and android on which you can develop
                  applications to communicate using Internet securely with authentication, integrity, confidentiality
                  and non-repudiation of data together with the access control. .</p>
